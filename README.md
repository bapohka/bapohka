### [Renovation of Pagoda in Koh Samui, Thailand](https://aseannow.com/topic/1350347-ukrainian-volunteers-renovate-pra-buddha-d%C4%ABpankara-pagoda/#google_vignette)
It was a totally new volunteering experience for me. Gathering with several people, receiving blessing from monks, communication and planning with people speaking only Thai language, crazy bamboo construction and a lot of bad roads heading to that hill every morning for several months.
